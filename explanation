Sure, I'll explain the code line by line:

ruby
Copy code
def sort_names_by_height(names, heights)
This line defines a method called sort_names_by_height that takes two parameters: names and heights. The method will sort the names array based on the corresponding heights in the heights array.

ruby
Copy code
  # Combine names and heights into a single array of pairs
  people = names.zip(heights)
Here, the zip method is used to combine the names and heights arrays into a new array called people. zip takes each element from both arrays at the same index and groups them into pairs. For example, names.zip(heights) will result in the following array of pairs:

css
Copy code
[["Alice", 165], ["Bob", 180], ["Charlie", 155], ["David", 175]]
Each pair contains a name and its corresponding height.

ruby
Copy code
  # Sort the array by heights in descending order
  sorted_people = people.sort_by { |name, height| -height }
The sort_by method is used to sort the people array in descending order based on the second element of each pair, which is the height. The syntax sort_by { |name, height| -height } tells Ruby to sort the array based on the negation of the height. This means that the array will be sorted in descending order of heights.

ruby
Copy code
  # Extract the sorted names
  sorted_names = sorted_people.map { |name, height| name }
Here, the map method is used to extract the names from the sorted_people array. The map method applies the given block to each element of the array and returns a new array containing the results. In this case, we are only interested in the names, so we use { |name, height| name } to extract the first element (the name) from each pair in the sorted_people array.

ruby
Copy code
  return sorted_names
end
Finally, the sort_names_by_height method returns the sorted_names array, which contains the names sorted in descending order based on their corresponding heights.

The example usage of the method follows:

ruby
Copy code
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"]
heights = [165, 180, 155, 175]
sorted_names = sort_names_by_height(names, heights)
puts sorted_names
In this example, it will output the following sorted names:

css
Copy code
["Bob", "David", "Alice", "Charlie"]
The names are sorted in descending order of their corresponding heights, which are [180, 175, 165, 155].
